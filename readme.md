# Solana Hello World Program

This project is a simple Solana program that demonstrates the basic structure of a Solana smart contract. It includes a client application that interacts with the deployed program, sending a transaction and logging messages.

## Features

- A simple Solana program that logs "Hello, world!" when executed.
- A client application that connects to the Solana Devnet.
- Automatic balance check and airdrop request for the payer account.
- Transaction signing and confirmation with detailed logging.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Rust**: Install Rust programming language from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- **Solana CLI**: Install the Solana Command Line Tools. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
- **Node.js**: Required for running JavaScript applications (if needed).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


2. **Build the Program**:
Ensure you are in the project directory and run:
cargo build-bpf


3. **Deploy the Program**:
Use the Solana CLI to deploy your program to Devnet:
solana program deploy target/deploy/your_program_name.so


4. **Configure Keypair**:
Place your keypair JSON file in the project directory or update the path in `client.rs`:
let payer = read_keypair_file("../my-keypair2.json").expect("Failed to read keypair file");


5. **Set Up Environment**:
Ensure you have a valid Solana configuration pointing to Devnet:
solana config set -ud


## Usage

1. **Run the Client Application**:
After deploying your program, run the client application:

## Usage

1. **Run the Client Application**:
After deploying your program, run the client application:
cargo run --bin client


2. **Observe Output**:
The client will check the balance of your payer account, request an airdrop if necessary, send a transaction to the program, and print out any log messages generated by the program.

## Code Overview

### `lib.rs`

The core logic of the Solana program is implemented in `lib.rs`. The main function logs "Hello, world!" when invoked.

### `client.rs`

The client application connects to the Solana network, checks account balances, requests an airdrop if necessary, constructs a transaction, and sends it to the deployed program.

## Logging

To enable detailed logging output during execution, ensure you have `env_logger` set up in your dependencies. The logs will provide insights into transaction processing and any messages emitted by your program.
